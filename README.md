# SDM

I am:
- a professional Software Developer
- a graduate of the University of Waterloo
- an introvert (ISTP to be precise)
- a husband and father
- Canadian 🍁

What is SDM?

Here are some options:
- Software Development Module (simple enough)
- Software Development Master (sounds a bit too pompous 😒)
- Software Development Mechanic (I do like to fix software 🛠)
- Software Development Mentor (I hope other people find this space useful)
- Software Dungeon Master (why not? 👹)
- it is also just my initials 😉
